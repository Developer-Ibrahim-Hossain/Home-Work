          <h2>LIFE IS NOT A BED OF ROSES !</h2>
            <p>Life is not a bed of roses neither it is full of  thorns. Life is full of struggle but there is a lot of problems and challenges faced by the people in daily life. Prosperity in every field of life never comes to you on its own. You have to struggle hard to get to it. A good example is that of a sports person. A boxer can only win a fight based on the amount of effort and hard work. People are exposed to a number of problems and challenges, and it is only when such obstacles are tackled will a person be able to be successful. Success can never be earned by staying idle and this implies that it is important to put an effort to increase the chances of becoming successful in life. Life is full of struggle and challenges, and if we want to succeed we should always keep our trust in               <strong style="color: #fff;">Allah Almighty</strong> and also in ourselves.
    
              Success or failure, Happiness or sorrow, moments are part of life and vary from person to person, if you have not faced the moments of failure, you cannot realize the worth of happiness or success. I do not concur with these, we just keep a firm belief in Allah. Allah knows that what is best for us because Allah is the only and unique creator of the whole universe and the one who can give solutions to our problems. Sometimes people think that there is no hope of success and finds darkness everywhere.

            <h2>Love your self !</h2>
            <p>Learning to love yourself in life is very important. You can't know yourself well until you learn to love yourself.</p>
            <img  class="img" src="img/profile picture.png" alt="Ibrahim Hossain">
    
              
             <p>So always Love yourself. Knowing yourself means you know who you are, what you can do, what you love to do. And these things will help you to be happy. How successful you are in your life also depends a little bit on this subject. Explore your life in the ocean and find out what every meaning of life is. You will see that life has given you something that you never imagined. If you know yourself, you will know and understand your world much better.</p>
